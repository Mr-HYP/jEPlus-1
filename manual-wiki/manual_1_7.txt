===== Table of Contents =====

<WRAP indent>

**[[docs:manual_1_7_intro|Chapter 1 Introduction]]** -- This chapter describes how jEPlus works with diagrams, and explains some of the key concepts and terminologies used in this users guide. Also covered are the things you need to know about installing the software.

**[[docs:manual_1_7_gui|Chapter 2 The GUI]]** -- Illustrated description of the graphical user interface, including the menu structure, the project tab, the execution tab, the utilities tab, and the output/editor pane. User controls are annotated on the screenshots.

**[[docs:manual_1_7_project|Chapter 3 jEPlus Project]]** -- This chapter explains the contents of a jEPlus project, such as the model template files, weather files, the RVI/MVI files (the default method for E+ result collection), and the parameter tree. Also shown are GUI for TRNSYS and INSEL projects.

**[[docs:manual_1_7_params|Chapter 4 Parameter Definition]]** -- This chapter is all about the jEPlus parameter definitions, and the various syntax you can use to specify the parameter values to be used in a parametric project. 

**[[docs:manual_1_7_rvx|Chapter 5 Result Extraction]]** -- jEPlus v1.7 provides more flexible and customisable ways of extracting results from simulations using the new RVX file. This chapter explains the syntax of the RVX file, and the use of ReadVarsEso, SQLite, CSV and Python scripts in result collection. 

**[[docs:manual_1_7_exec|Chapter 6 Running Simulations]]** -- The simulation execution options jEPlus provides are described in this chapter. You can test and run a jEPlus project in various ways, such as using random sampling. The control of computing resource is explained here, too.

**[[docs:manual_1_7_utils|Chapter 7 Utilities]]** -- jEPlus includes a few useful tools to help you prepare your project and extract/post-process results. These utilities include an EnergyPlus version updater shell, a Python script tester/executor, and an E+ ReadVars executor.

**[[docs:manual_1_7_script|Chapter 8 Using Python in jEPlus]]** -- You can use Python in more ways in jEPlus v1.7 than before. This chapter summarizes how to use Python scripts in pre-processing and post-processing stages, and tips on how to test your scripts in jEPlus. 

**[[docs:manual_1_7_advanced|Chapter 9 Interface with jEPlus]]** -- For advanced users, the command-line interface and the programming interface of jEPlus are explained in this chapter. Also covered are the use of the job list files, the parameter file and skeleton project.

**[[docs:manual_1_7_examples|Chapter 10 Examples]]** -- A few examples are described in this chapter, including the use of EP-Macro, and the different ways to parameterize window size.
